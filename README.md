OpenSpritz.NET
==============

A .NET recreation of the speed reading software.

Usage
=====

Download the ZIP/Clone. If you are using a version of Visual Studio, please compile. Binaries are located in OpenSpritz.NET\bin\Debug

Why?
====

The spritz reading application is great, however it only works for the text they provided. I wanted to use spritz to study for my Social Science exam. So I googled, and found great remakes. But none of them stopped at punctuations or felt like the actual Spritz.
